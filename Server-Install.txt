These are TEMPORARY instructions, and may become obsolete 
within a week or two!


---- BEGIN ONE-TIME SETUP ----
1. Go to the top-level MartusServer directory. If you are a developer
   running eclipse, this will be something like:
     C:\work\eclipse-martus\martus-mspa\bin>
   
   If you are running a test server, it would be where the MartusServer
   jar is located, which on Windows is:
     c:\MartusServer
   
   and give this command:
     rmic -d . org.martus.mspa.network.roothelper.MessengerImpl
     
   If it says "rmic command not found" or something like that, you will 
   need to have a developer do this step for you. It will create a file
   that you should copy to your MartusServer directory.
   
   (Later, this will be part of the ANT build script, so it will be automated

2. Create c:\MSPAServer with:
   adminTriggers\
   deleteOnStartup\
       keypair.dat
       clientsWhoCallUs\
   MartusServerData\

---- END ONE-TIME SETUP ----


3. For each MSPA client that you want to allow in, copy their server-format 
public key file into the authorizedClients directory. 
The filenames do not matter.

NOTE: If you are trying to manage an existing development server, 
you will need to copy files from that server's directory into 
the MartusServerData directory. They will NOT be copied back to 
your development server, because that is normally handled by a 
Scott-script on the production servers.


For each of the following commands, if you are running them from 
the server jar, the command should be:
  java -cp MartusServer.jar xxxxxxxx

They should be run from the top-level directory, such as C:\MartusServer
  
4. Run org.martus.mspa.roothelper.RootHelper (no parameters needed)

5. Run org.martus.mspa.server.MSPAServer (no parameters needed)

6. You can now run an MSPA client and connect to this MSPAServer (listener).
