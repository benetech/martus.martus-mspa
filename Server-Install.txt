Notes for getting the MSPA server running on a windows box

These are TEMPORARY instructions, and may become obsolete 
within a week or two!


---- BEGIN ONE-TIME SETUP ----
1. Go to this directory:
     C:\work\eclipse-martus\martus-mspa\bin>
   
   and give this command:
     rmic -d . org.martus.mspa.network.roothelper.MessengerImpl
     
   (Later, this will be part of the ANT build script, so it will be automated

2. Create c:\MSPAServer with:
   adminTriggers\
   deleteOnStartup\
       keypair.dat
       clientWhoCallUs\
   MartusServerData\

---- END ONE-TIME SETUP ----


3. For each MSPA client that you want to allow in, copy their server-format 
public key file into the authorizedClients directory. 
The filenames do not matter.

NOTE: If you are trying to manage an existing development server, 
you will need to copy files from that server's directory into 
the MartusServerData directory. They will NOT be copied back to 
your development server, because that is normally handled by a 
Scott-script on the production servers.

  
4. Run org.martus.mspa.network.roothelper.RootHelper (no parameters needed)

5. Run org.martus.mspa.server.MSPAServer (no parameters needed)

6. You can now run an MSPA client and connect to this MSPAServer (listener).
