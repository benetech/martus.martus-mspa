Notes for getting the MSPA client working on your workstation.
2004-04-07 Kevin B. Smith

These are TEMPORARY instructions, and will probably be obsolete 
within a week or two!


1. You will need to create a keypair as c:/MSPAClient/keypair.dat
The easiest way to do this is by running org.martus.server.tools.CreateKeyPair
NOTE: You must include both a password and a username in the password,
in the form:   password:username

2. You will need to export your public key, and send it to the 
MSPA listener operator. The easiest way to do this is to run
org.martus.server.tools.ExportPublicKey
Remember to enter password:username

Note that the public key MUST be in the "server" public key format, and 
not in the format generated by the Martus Client "Export my public key" 
command.

3. You will need the public key file for the MSPA Listener. It must be 
named with the correct IP address and public code. This file must be placed 
in the c:/MSPAClient/serverToCall/ directory.

4. Run org.martus.mspa.main.MSPAMain and enter your username and password 
to sign in.
